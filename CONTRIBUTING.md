# Development setup

First, fork this repo

## Chrome

1. Open the [Chrome extension settings](chrome://extensions/)
1. Click `Load unpacked` and select this project

## Firefox

1. Click `Load temporary add-on` and select the manifest.json for this project

You should now be able to use the extension as described in the [README](README.md). You'll need to click the refresh button on the extension settings to reload the extension after code changes.

## Testing locally

You can run the tests with

```
yarn test
```

We use Jest. To update the snapshots after making changes, you can run

```

Don't forget to review the updates and make sure only intended changes are included!

# Pull Requests

- _Document any change in behaviour._ Make sure the README and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.
- _Create topic branches._ Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.
- _One pull request per feature._ If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.
- _Send coherent history._ Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please squash them before sending them to us.

# How to release (Admin-only)

Only needed for user-facing changes!

1. Bump the version in `manifest.json` and get changes merged to master
1. **Chrome** - create a new release on the Github repo, tagged with the new version (this triggers the deployment)
1. **Firefox** - create a .zip (`git archive -o dtt.zip HEAD`) and upload it to the Firefox store via [the developer hub](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/developers/addons)

### Notes:

- If you don't bump the version in `manifest.json`, the upload to the Chrome Web Store will fail. It will look like everything passed in CircleCI until you dig into the logs of the "Publish" step.
- It can take up to an hour for the changes to be reflected in the Chrome Web Store.
- Your browser will automatically update the extension when ready, there's no need to re-download manually from the store.
